# Python-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp-Projects

My solutions for the projects given in the Udemy course: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla. I have listed the topics covered in the course below, and notice that not all of the topics have a project. The instructor also follows the ISLR book along with the Machine Learning topics.

Use Spark for Big Data Analysis
Implement Machine Learning Algorithms
0) Jupyter Notebook Overview
1) NumPy for Numerical Data
2) Pandas for Data Analysis
3) Matplotlib for Python Plotting
4) Seaborn for statistical plots
5) Plotly (and Cufflinks) for interactive dynamic visualizations
7) Geographical Plotting (Choropleth Maps)
8) DATA CAPSTONE PROJECT INCLUDING TOPICS ABOVE
6) SciKit-Learn for Machine Learning
